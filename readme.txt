This is free and open source software, if you paid for this you were scammed
Made by "EZTLI" on earth by humans roughly 2024 rotations around the sun after the death of our savior

The new tool (selector.py)
will allow you to pick from the following
1, Read documentation(windows only)
	1, main pipeline
	2, extra pipeline

2, Open contact information(windows only)

3, Use interpreter(all os's)
	1, main pipeline
	2, extra pipeline
But... Im bad at programming and it wont work.
Instead i provided the code in the ksl bramch 
so you can create your own menu or API I guess

Filetypes {

FOR MAIN PIPELINE
knifesharp(input): .ks .dxs
output: .txt .dxx .dx .yaml .yml
note: these are just prefered filetypes

FOR EXTRA PIPELINE
ks(in): .ks2 .exks .dxs2
out: .dx2 .exdx
note: these are just prefered filetype

}

For extra documentation on inter.py, read /docs/doc1
For extra documentation on exinterpreter.py, read /docs/doc2
For my contact info, read contact.txt
